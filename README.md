### Hey I'm Estelle 🌟

I'm a Research Engineer exploring a mixture of condensed matter physics, algebraic geometry and category theory, hardware development, and data infrastructure. I also study mathematical physics at UWaterloo 🌌. Previously, I've worked in DeFi for around 3 years, mainly working on mechanism design research for on-chain portfolio replication with [Primitive](https://www.primitive.xyz/). Always looking for fun mathy projects to work on!

- 🔭 I'm currently reading

### Papers

- 🕹️ [Financial Virtual Machine](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/yellow.pdf) - Feb 2023
  - The Financial Virtual Machine (FVM) is designed to be a general purpose Finite State Machine (FSM), built on top of the EVM, that can be used to interact with a variety of structured financial products.
- 📈 [Replicating Portfolios: Constructing Permissionless Derivatives](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/Constructing_Permissionless_Derivatives.pdf) - May 2022
  - Example reconstructions of traditional structured products built around RMM-01. Concludes CFMMs are invaluable for structured product design with minimized trust dependencies.
- 🏛️ [Primitive RMM-01](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/Whitepaper.pdf) - Oct 2021
  - An implementation of an RMM that approximates a Black–Scholes covered call, which we called RMM-01.
