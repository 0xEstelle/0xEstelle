### Hey I'm Estelle 🌟

I'm an extremely curious transgender research engineer and mathematical physics student at University of Waterloo 🌌. I have a giant cat companion named Sushi 🍣, she's twice the size of your average kitty 🐱. I really enjoy building data-intensive simulations and other larger scale data processing applications, and recently have started rebuilding my simulation and analytics stack in Rust 🦀 for performance and scalability reasons. I've worked in decentralized finance for a little over two years now, working alongside [Primitive](https://github.com/primitivefinance) as their Head of Research until this past summer. I have since gone back to school full-time, and am hoping to explore other applications of distributed systems in research and governance.

- 🔭 I'm currently learning how to use Apache Flink and reading [Multiple Time Scale Dynamics](https://www.amazon.ca/Multiple-Scale-Dynamics-Christian-Kuehn/dp/331934417X)
- 🌱 I'm building a unified data analytics platform in Rust 🦀 using [Timely Dataflow](https://github.com/TimelyDataflow/timely-dataflow).
- 🖥️ I work mainly in Rust, Python, SQL, GraphQL, LaTeX, Julia, and R

### Education

BSc - Mathematical Physics (In-progress, expected 2026)

Working through my undergraduate degree in mathematical physics while I explore interesting areas of tech to focus on as a research engineer!

### Papers

- 🕹️ [Financial Virtual Machine](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/yellow.pdf) - Feb 2023
  - The Financial Virtual Machine (FVM) is designed to be a general purpose Finite State Machine (FSM), built on top of the EVM, that can be used to interact with a variety of structured financial products.
- 📈 [Replicating Portfolios: Constructing Permissionless Derivatives](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/Constructing_Permissionless_Derivatives.pdf) - May 2022
  - Example reconstructions of traditional structured products built around RMM-01. Concludes CFMMs are invaluable for structured product design with minimized trust dependencies.
- 🏛️ [Primitive RMM-01](https://www.primitive.xyz/papers/Whitepaper.pdf) - Oct 2021
  - An implementation of an RMM that approximates a Black–Scholes covered call, which we called RMM-01.
