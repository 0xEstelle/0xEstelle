### Hey I'm Estelle 🌟

I'm an extremely curious transgender research engineer and mathematical physics student at University of Waterloo 🌌. I've been an active researcher in decentralized finance for a little over two years now, working alongside [Primitive](https://github.com/primitivefinance) for a lot of it. My current research interests include applications of geometric algebra and sheaf cohomology in areas of software research such as, cybersecurity, data and networking infrastructure, and simulation tech, as well as exploring pathfinding algorithms on dynamic networks. I'm interested in learning about homotopy type theory and maybe exploring Rust packages that do stuff like [this](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl).
