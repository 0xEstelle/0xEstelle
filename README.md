### Hey I'm Estelle 🌟

I'm a Research Engineer currently exploring a mixture of condensed matter physics, algebraic geometry and category theory, and hardware development. I also study mathematical physics at UWaterloo 🌌. I really love anything algebraic geometry, category theory, and network theory, and lately have been thinking about applications of this in signal processing, sensor fusion, and data infra. It's led me to start playing with embedded systems and sensor networks (would love to collaborate on this more!) On the physics side of things, I have the broad focus of exploring quantum phases of matter from the lense of algebraic geometry and category theory, particularly focusing on critical phenomena. I would love to start looking into quantum hardware development.

### DeFi Research

In my past life, I led research on decentralized portfolio management at [Primitive](). My focus was primarily on exploring applications of dynamically-adjusted CFMMs (of which we called DFMMs) in structured product design and trust-less on-chain portfolio management. I particularly was focused on institutional/treasury management use cases, as they are the exact class of consumers in need of this passificity and trustless design. There are still plenty of open questions in this area that interest me, so I'm always open to people shooting me a DM with other cool problems in this area! You can find some of my writings on portfolio management below:
